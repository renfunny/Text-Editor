## Description

Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is a text editor that runs in the browser following PWA criteria which features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case the browser does not support one of the options given. This application can also be installed in the user's computer and work offline. Building this project helped me practice and get comfortable using a handfull of packages such as: babel, multiple webpacks, and plugins. It also served as a great example to showcase how progressive web applications work and are developed.

## Installation

To run this application in the browser the user will need to clone the code, and have node.js installed. Once cloned, the user must open the code using a code editor, and run the command `npm install` in the terminal to install all packages needed for the app to work. Once installed the user must run the command `npm start` which will start the application in the user's browser.

## Usage

This project can be used to show how PWAs are developed and structured, the application itself can be used to store data that the user might need, such as notes which will be formatted as code, with each element having its corresponding color. If the user wishes to install the application for offline use the `Install!` button can be pressed on the top left of the page which will give the user the option to do so.
